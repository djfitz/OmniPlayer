/**
    A protocol for updating a view based on Media Player messages.

    This protocol allows the audio engine to manage a UI widget
    state, based on client-supplied standard controls.
    For example, the protocol has properties for a play button and
    a pause button. A UI client can create and style any view that
    uses standard UIButtons, the audio engine can then update those
    buttons based on state changes. This relieves the client app
    from having to manage these complicated state changesin the UI
    themselves.
